# Fortune Teller

This project provides a simple fortune telling service based on Thai and Chinese traditions.

## Usage

Run the CLI application:

```bash
python3 fortune.py
```

You will be prompted for the day of the week and your birth year. The program will then output your Thai fortune followed by your Chinese zodiac fortune.

To run the Streamlit web app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This launches a web interface where you can select your birth day and year to display both fortunes.

## Requirements

The only Python package needed is `streamlit`. Install it with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
